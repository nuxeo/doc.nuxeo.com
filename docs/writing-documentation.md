### Mac:
- Install homebrew (http://brew.sh/) and run
    
```bash
# Update
brew update
# Install git
brew install git
```

## Installation 

**[master, 710 and 60 branches](https://github.com/nuxeo/doc.nuxeo.com-content)**: For all the versioned documentation (nxdoc/userdoc/admindoc). The versions work with branches, one version = one branch. 

**[Static Branch](https://github.com/nuxeo/doc.nuxeo.com-content/tree/static)**: For non-versioned documentation (studio/idedoc/corg)

Clone the repository to your local machine, using your favorite Git client or the command line:
```bash
git lfs clone git@github.com:nuxeo/doc.nuxeo.com-content.git
cd doc.nuxeo.com-content
git lfs install
git reset --hard
```
#### Run Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Once started go to your http://localhost:3000 and add `/nxdoc` or `/userdoc` at the end to the address to access it, as it's the versioned space. 


Have a look at the [new-page-template.md](new-page-template.md) with your editor or [view the raw source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuxeo/doc.nuxeo.com/master/docs/new-page-template.md).

For more information, have a look at the READMEs of the two repositories. 

# Create a Page
The recommended editor is Atom. It handles markdown nicely and can provide a live preview, fast file finding and image previewing.

**As a lot of people are contributing on the documentation, every creation or edition should go through a Pull Request to be reviewed by the doc team.**

## Editor Configuration

YAML doesn't enjoy having tabs so ensure your editor is configured with _soft_ tabs (spaces).

## Mandatory frontmatter

The documentation uses YAML at the top between two sets of `---`, this section is known as _frontmatter_.
This frontmatter will gather all the information about the page: title, description, review date, historic, tags (formerly known as tags in Confluence), etc. In order to be correctly displayed in the documentation, all `.md` (Markdown) content files should have a YAML frontmatter defined at the top of the file which is:

```md
---
title: Title Of The Page
description: A description for search engines and social media to consume.
review:
    date: '2016-09-14'
    status: ok
    comment: ''
---

Content of page goes here.
```

Frontmatter | Behaviour
--- | ---
`title: Title Of The Page` | The page title
`description: A description...` | This is used for Search Engines and social media to describe the page.
`review: Object` | See [Review section below](#review).

### Review

Review data helps to flag pages that have not been reviewed within the desired period and to mark pages as having issues.

`date` must be in [iso date format `YYYY-MM-DD`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

`status` must be **'ok'**, **'not-ok'** or **'requiresUpdates'**

`comment` is optional but should be used to describe what is incorrect with the page if the status is set to **'not-ok'** or **'requiresUpdates'**. Markdown will be converted and multiline text can be added.
_Note_: The comment is displayed on the page.

#### Multiline comment example
```
...
review:
    date: '2016-09-14'
    status: ok
    comment: |-
        I'm a multiline comment
        with **markdown** included

        - list items
        - if necessary
...
```


## Optional frontmatter

Frontmatter | Behaviour
--- | ---
`hidden: true` | Hidden from the hierarchy menu
`toc: true` | Adds a table of contents derived from h2..h4  (`## h2` .. `#### h4`) headings
`tabbed_page: true` | Convert the page to display a tabbed interface. h1 (`# h1`) headings are used as titles of each tab. `{{! end_of_tabs }}` can placed after the last section to allow content to be placed beneath the tabbed section.
`redirect: /redirect/location` | Adds a redirect to the location specified. Accepts a url or `version/space/page name` (`710/nxdoc/installation` / `/nxdoc/installation` / `installation`)
`no_side_menu: true` | Hides the hierarchy menu for that page.
`tree_item_index: 1` | For ordering the left hierarchical menu. Items are ordered by `tree_item_index` and then alphabetically. To ease the maintenance of ordering pages in the left.
`section_parent: section-name` | Sets the section for this page and its children.
`section_override: section-name` | Overrides the hierarchical section.
`previous_link: version/space/page-name` | Adds previous link to the bottom of the page.
`next_link: version/space/page-name` | Adds next link to the bottom of the page.
`notes:>-` | Add a note on the page. 

### Overriding Version Links
This feature allows the version links to point to a different page.

To remove the link for **LTS 2015**:
```yaml
version_override:
    'FT': '.../...'
    'LTS 2015': 710/.../...
    '6.0': 60/.../...
```

Example, to point **LTS 2015** and **6.0** each to a new page:
```yaml
version_override:
    'LTS 2015': 710/nxdoc/installation
    '6.0': 60/nxdoc/installation
```
This accepts the [single attribute form](#single-attribute-form--legacy).

_Note_: the label (e.g. `LTS 2015`) needs to be quoted, this is part of the YAML specification.

## Macros
### Excerpt
```handlebars
{{! excerpt}}
.
.
.
{{! /excerpt}}
```
### Multi-Excerpt
```handlebars
{{! multiexcerpt name=â€™name-of-your-multiexcerpt'}}
.
.
.
{{! /multiexcerpt}}
```
### Panels
Panels should be written like this:
```handlebars
{{#> callout type='info' heading='Info'}}
Content.
{{/callout}}
```
The type can be an info, a warning, a tip or a note.
If you want to create just a basic panel, it should be written like this:  
```handlebars
{{#> panel type='basic' heading='Basic Panel' match_height=true no_markdown=true}} -->
Content.
{{/panel}}
```
### Tabs
If you want to add tabs to your page, you will need to add `tabbed_page: true` in your frontmatter. This will convert all the h1 of your page as title of each tab. </br>
`\{{! end_of_tabs }}` can be placed after the last section to allow content to be placed beneath the tabbed section.

## Links

We recommand you to install the [nuxeo-documentation-links](https://atom.io/packages/nuxeo-documentation-links) addon on Atom to be able to have suggestions while typing links to pages or files. 

### To a Page
Example: for `WebEngine (JAX-RS)`, You can access it by:
`{{page page='webengine-jax-rs'}}`

The page identifier is taken from the name of the file. e.g. `webengine-jax-rs.md` would be accessed by `webengine-jax-rs`.

If the page is in another space you can add a `space` attribute.
If you were in `userdoc` and wanted to access `WebEngine (JAX-RS)` in `nxdoc`.
`{{page space='nxdoc' page='webengine-jax-rs'}}`

Similar if you wish to access a different version add a `version` attribute.
`{{page version='710' space='nxdoc' page='webengine-jax-rs'}}`

#### Single attribute form / Legacy
Single attribute form is also allowed to facilitate the Confluence legacy form.
`{{page page='710/nxdoc/webengine-jax-rs'}}`

To allow for link definitions from Confluence, the following also work.
```
{{page page='WebEngine (JAX-RS)'}}
{{page page='NXDOC:WebEngine (JAX-RS)'}}
{{page page='NXDOC710:WebEngine (JAX-RS)'}}
```
_Tip_: See [links with parenthesis](#links-with-parenthesis-mdash-).

#### Links with parenthesis &mdash; ()
These require us to use the reference style of links:
```md
[Link text][link-reference]
[link-reference]: http://example.com/link(with)parenthesis "Optional title for link"
```

### To an Excerpt
* In the same version:
`{{{excerpt space='space' page='page-name'}}}`
    - Example: `{{{excerpt space='studio' page='studio-overview-and-concepts'}}}`
* In another version: 
`{{{excerpt space='space' version='version' page='page-name'}}}`

### To a Multi-Excerpt
* In the same version:
  ```
  {{{multiexcerpt 'name' page='page-name'}}}
  ```
* In another version:
  ```
  {{{multiexcerpt 'name' version='version' space='space' page='page-name'}}}
  ```

### To Images
Link to images should be written like this:
`![name-of-the-image]({{file version='VERSION' space='SPACE' page='page-name' name='image-name.png'}})`

You can call an image from a different page, space or version. 

An image called `your_img.png` could be referenced by the following:
```md
Basic example:
![Alt text - Required]({{file name='your_img.png'}})
```
All options with file from another space and page:
```
![Alt text - Required]({{file space='nxdoc' page='client-sdks' name='your_img.png'}} ?w=180,h=360,border=true,thumbnail=true,align=right "Title text - Optional")
```

#### Image options

Option | Behaviour
--- | ---
`w=x` | Sets the image width. Replace `x` with the value in pixels. _Note:_ Images greater than 32 will automatically get the thumbnail attribute.
`h=y` | Sets the image height. Replace `y` with the value in pixels.
`border=true` | Gives the image a border.
`thumbnail=true` | Make the image show a larger version upon clicking.
`inline=true` | Allows images to be put side by side.
`align=right` | Positions the image to the right.

### To Download Files
Link to download files should be written like this:
`[Text for download link]({{file space='space' page='page-name' name='file-name.zip'}})`

A file called `your_file.zip` could be referenced by the following:
```md
Basic example:
[Download my file]({{file name='your_file.zip'}})
```

### To Videos
You can link to video from Wistia with the `id` provided:
`{{> wistia_video id='id-of-the-video'}}`

### To Anchors
Anchors to titles will enable you to create links to specific section of a page. By default, every titles have an anchor, for example `## Functional Overview` will create an anchor `functional-overview`. 

The link to call an anchor should be written like this: 
`({{page page='my-page-filename'}}#functional-overview)`

If you want to add an anchor on a specific section, you can add the following:
`{{> anchor 'functional-overview'}}`


## Markdown and Handlebars
The documentation uses standard [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), this documentation explains the added feature set using Markdown with [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/#html-escaping) and some of the helpers and partials we have available.

### Handlebars helpers

Helper | Behaviour
--- | ---
`{{condition foo '===' bar}}` | Allows variable comparisons. Usual usage: `{{#if (condition foo '===' bar)}}...{{/if}}`
`{{page ...}}` | See [Page Links](#to-a-page)
`{{file ...}}` | See [Links to Images](#to-images) and/or [Links to Downloading Files](#to-download-files)
`{{file_content url='url'}}` | Retrieves content from an external url. Usual usage `{{{md (file_content url='https://example.com/url-to-raw-markdown-file.md')}}}`
`{{md foo}}` | Converts a variable from Markdown.
`{{moment foo format='D MMM YYYY'}}` | [Formats a date](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) variable using moment. Alternative usage: `{{moment foo fromNow=''}}` displays a period from now. e.g. '3 days ago'
`{{sluggy foo}}` | Converts a variable to a url slug. e.g. 'Title Of Page' > 'title-of-page'
`{{table_from_details ...}}` | See [Table from details (filter-table)](#table-from-details-filter-table)


### Handlebars Partials

Partial | Behaviour
--- | ---
`{{#> accordian heading='title' closed=true}}Content{{/accordian}}` | Adds an accordian element that is closed by default. `closed` is optional
`{{> anchor 'anchor-id'}}` | Adds an anchor into the content. _Note_: Anchors are added to every heading by default. e.g. `## Functional Overview` will create an anchor `functional-overview`
`{{#> callout type='info' no_icon=true heading='Title'}}Content{{/callout}}` | Callouts display a warning or information block for the user. `type` can be: 'tip', 'success',  'hint', 'info', 'warning' or 'note'.  `heading` and `no_icon` are optional
`{{> children}}` | Display an _unordered_ list of the children from the current page
`{{> panel type='info' heading='Title' match_height=true no_markdown=true}}Content{{/panel}}` | Similar to the callout partial, creates a bordered section. `type` is optional and can be 'primary', 'secondary', 'success', 'warning', 'alert'. `match_height` and `no_markdown` are optional
`{{> wistia_video id='9pfro1cpv1'}}` | Inserts a Wistia Video using the `id` provided


### Table from details (filter-table)
`details` can be put into a table for display

#### Basic Example (without filtering)

The following definition will display `howto` details from `nxdoc` and `studio` spaces and include these fields: `Excerpt`, `Topics` and `Level`.

By default the table will include `Title` with a link to that page.
```
{{{table_from_details label='howto' spaces='nxdoc, studio' heading='Excerpt, Topics, Level'}}}
```

#### Filtering Tables

Expanding from the previous example, this will limit to only `Advanced` pages with `translate` in the excerpt field. Sorted by `topics`
```
{{{table_from_details label='howto' spaces='nxdoc, studio' heading='Excerpt, Topics, Level' filter='level=advanced, excerpt=translate' sort_by='topics'}}}
```

#### Options

Option | Behaviour
--- | ---
`headings='Fields, Separated By Comma'` | The fields aren't case sensitive but need to match the field within `details` frontmatter.
`label='name_of_label'` | The label of the data from within `details`.
`spaces='nxdoc, admindoc'` | These are which spaces to get the information from. Can be space separated if desired. For versions these should be in the form `{version}/{space}` e.g. `710/nxdoc, 60/nxdoc`
`sort_by='field'` | Field to sort the table results by.
`filter='field_name=search_text, another_field=search_text'` | Filter the table by fields with text values. Case-insensitive.
`filter_type='and'` | If mulitiple fields are being filtered upon, `and` will mean all fields have to have a match for the row to be present in the table. Defaults to `or` if omitted.

# Edit a Page
## Modify Review Date

Once you have entirely reviewed a page, and that you consider that it's OK or not, you will have to update the review flag. If the page is ok, update the date only, if it's not-ok you will have to change the status and add a comment. 
`comment` is mandatory to describe what is incorrect with the page if the status is set to `not-ok` or `requiresUpdates`. Markdown will be converted and multiline text can be added.
{{#> callout type='note'}} Make sure that the comment is well written as it is displayed on the page to inform the viewer what is the problem on the page.{{/callout}}

A multiline comment is possible, it should look like this:

```
---
review:
  date: 'yyyy-mm-dd'
  status: ok|not-ok|requiresUpdates
  comment: |-
      I'm a multiline comment
      with **markdown** included

      - list items
      - if necessary
---
```


## Global optional frontmatter
### `style`
Define a page specific style sheet. Defined in `doc.nuxeo.com/client/scss/`. e.g. To use `doc.nuxeo.com/client/scss/home.scss`, the front-matter would be:
```md
---
...
style: home
...
---
Page content here.
```
### `script`
Define a page specific JavaScript. Defined in `doc.nuxeo.com/client/js/`. e.g. To use `doc.nuxeo.com/client/scss/home.js`, the front-matter would be:
```md
---
...
script: home
...
---
Page content here.
```

For new JS, add an entry to `doc.nuxeo.com/webpack.config.js`. See `main.js` as an example.
